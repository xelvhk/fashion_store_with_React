<h1>Fashion store project with React</h1>
<h2>What's this?</h2>
<p>This is my first attempt to create a project on <strong>React</strong>.<br>
I made a few components for blocks of landing page. Some of them are: "Arrivals" with cards of products, "Download" with links to app stores, "Promo" and "Voucher" with promo information</p>
<table>
<tr>
<td><a href="#">Demo</a></td><td><a href="#">Code link</a></td>
</tr>
</table>
<details>
<summary>Screenshot of app page</summary><img src="#"></details>

### How can i run this?
- Clone this repo with `git clone https://github.com/lexkh/first-project-fashion-react.git`;
- Go to the folder `first-project-fashion-react`;
- Print the command in terminal `npm i`;
- Print the command `npm run start` and then this app will be opened in browser at port `3000`;
